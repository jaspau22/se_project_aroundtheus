Project 3: Around The U.S.

Overview

In project 3, Around the U.S., we focus on implementing CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes. CSS Grid is a powerful tool for organizing content into structured layouts, ensuring images and text align properly.

One key feature we use is grid-template-columns, which defines the columns within a container. By using minmax(), we create flexible grid layouts that adjust dynamically based on screen width, preventing elements from getting squeezed together. Additionally, the auto value ensures images maintain their natural aspect ratio without distortion.

Another essential property is grid-template-areas, which helps structure the layout efficiently. It allows us to assign specific sections of the page to defined grid areas, making the layout more intuitive. However, it's crucial to note that grid-template-areas must always form a rectangular shape—if an “L” shape is formed, the layout will break, and no changes will be applied.

Figma also plays a crucial role in our design workflow. Designers use Figma to create the project's layout, and our job as developers is to implement margins, paddings, and spacing according to the design specifications. Collaboration with designers is key to ensuring that the final product remains consistent with the intended design while optimizing efficiency and reducing errors.

Why Grid and Flexbox?

We chose CSS Grid and Flexbox because they offer a flexible and adaptable layout that responds well to different screen sizes. Grid allows us to easily structure and align content, while Flexbox helps with spacing and alignment within individual elements. Together, they create a smooth and responsive experience for users.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
